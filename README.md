# DiseaseNameGame

My friends and I used to play this game at sleepovers. We would lay down and name diseases one-by-one until you couldn't or fell asleep. You couldn't repeat a disease that was named. I am seeking to recreate that game here as a silly side project. I plan to change from diseases to cities, just so it isn't so macabre.
